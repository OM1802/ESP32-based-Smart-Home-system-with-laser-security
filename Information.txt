This file conatain the details about the program used in this project which is included in the main.cpp file of this repository

Header Includes:
Various libraries are included for different functionalities: Wire.h for I2C communication, LiquidCrystal_I2C.h for interfacing with a LCD display, DHT.h for the DHT22 sensor, WiFi.h and WiFiClient.h for WiFi connectivity, and BlynkSimpleEsp32.h for interfacing with the Blynk IoT platform.
Definitions and Constants:
#define statements define pins, sensor types, and Blynk parameters.
Constants like DHTPIN, DHTTYPE, FANPIN, LDRPIN, LEDPIN, LASERPIN, BUZZERPIN, and others specify the GPIO pins used for various components.
Global Variables:
Variables to hold sensor readings (t for temperature, h for humidity), Blynk authentication token (auth), WiFi credentials (ssid and pass), and a flag to store the state of the buzzer (buzzerState).

Blynk Virtual Functions:
BLYNK_WRITE functions are used to handle data sent from the Blynk app.
BUZZER_CONTROL function updates the buzzerState based on the value received from the app.
V0 function controls the fan based on the value received from the app.
V1 and V2 functions send humidity and temperature data to the Blynk app, respectively.

Setup Function:
Initializes serial communication, LCD display, DHT sensor, and Blynk connection.
Sets pin modes for various components.
Connects to WiFi and prints a message when connected.

Loop Function:
Blynk.run() is called to handle Blynk-related tasks.
Sensor readings for temperature and humidity are obtained from the DHT sensor.
If the readings are valid, they are displayed on the LCD.
LED brightness is adjusted based on the LDR value.
The code checks the state of the laser module:
If the laser beam is broken and the buzzer is off, the buzzer beeps to indicate an intruder alert.
If the buzzer is turned off from the Blynk app, the buzzer is turned off.


Overall, this code enables remote monitoring and control of sensors and actuators through the Blynk app, allowing users to monitor temperature, humidity, 
and security status, and control devices like a fan and a buzzer.
